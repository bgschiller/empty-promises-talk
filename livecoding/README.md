# Login Refresh Challenge

This challenge takes you through a couple of real-world bugs in a small Vue app. If you've never used Vue before, don't worry. The code is fairly small, and there are `console.log` statements that should help guide you where you need to look.

To get started, clone this repo and run

```
npm install
npm run start
```

Then open your browser to `localhost:1234`. The rest of the instructions will appear in your browser.

Good luck!
